MagicBees-Localization
======================

Localization for Magic Bees.

To create a new locale, fork the project, make a copy of en_US.xml and rename it to the locale you will translate to.

Strings not provided by your localization will fall back to en_US; (ie if you do not provide a tag for it in the XML file, either because you aren't sure how to translate it or don't have time to, remove it completely and Magic Bees will use the American English string in its place.)
